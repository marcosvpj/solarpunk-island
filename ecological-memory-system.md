# Ecological Memory System Specification
## **"The Long Tomorrow" - World Persistence Framework**

### Core Philosophy
Each Long Tomorrow session inherits the **living archaeological record** of previous sessions. The landscape remembers every structure, every decision, and every civilization that came before, creating a cumulative world-building experience where past choices shape future possibilities.

### Transformation Rules

#### Natural Succession Patterns
**Parks → Forests**:
- *Transformation Time*: Automatic between sessions
- *Visual Evolution*: Maintained park areas become wild forests with dense canopy
- *Mechanical Benefit*: +1 material/turn passive generation per forest hex
- *Aesthetic*: Lush green hexes with particle effects (falling leaves, wildlife)

**Farms → Forests**:  
- *Transformation Time*: Automatic between sessions
- *Soil Memory*: Enriched farmland becomes "Fertile Forest" (+2 materials/turn)
- *Visual Distinction*: Brighter green with fruit trees, organized grove patterns
- *Strategic Implication*: High-value resource hexes that players want to preserve vs develop

**Abandoned/Destroyed Buildings → Resource Piles**:
- *Basic Structures*: 50% of construction cost recoverable as material piles
- *Advanced Structures*: 75% of cost + potential rare materials (research components)
- *Visual Design*: Organized salvage heaps with material type indicators
- *Decay Rate*: Resource piles lose 10% per session if not collected

### The Three-Choice Ruin System

#### High-Level Building Ruins
When significant structures (Level 3+ buildings, Monuments, Advanced Technology) are abandoned, they become **Interactive Ruins** with three distinct options:

#### **Option 1: Recycle** *(Immediate Resources)*
- **Resource Return**: 150% of original construction cost in mixed materials
- **Bonus Materials**: Chance for rare components (research materials, luxury items)
- **Time Cost**: 2 turns to fully dismantle
- **Visual Result**: Clean hex ready for new construction
- **Strategic Value**: Best for immediate resource needs, clears valuable land

#### **Option 2: Restore** *(Enhanced Reconstruction)*
- **Resource Cost**: 75% of original building construction cost
- **Bonus Levels**: Restored building starts at +2 levels above base
- **Unique Traits**: "Ancestral" buildings resist first disaster of each type
- **Time Cost**: 4 turns to restore to operational status
- **Visual Design**: Buildings show architectural fusion of old/new elements
- **Strategic Value**: Most resource-efficient way to get high-level buildings

#### **Option 3: Memorialize** *(Permanent Adjacency Bonus)*
- **Resource Cost**: 1 material to create memorial marker
- **Adjacency Effect**: +15% efficiency to ALL adjacent buildings (all 6 hexes)
- **Stacking Bonus**: Multiple memorial adjacencies stack additively
- **Permanence**: Memorials cannot be destroyed by disasters or events
- **Visual Design**: Elegant monuments with building-specific iconography
- **Strategic Value**: Long-term investment in district efficiency

### Soil Memory System

#### Soil Quality Inheritance
**Enriched Soil** *(from successful agriculture)*:
- **Visual**: Subtle golden tint to hex, small plant growth around edges
- **Mechanical**: +25% efficiency for any agricultural building
- **Accumulation**: Each successful harvest season adds +5% bonus (max 50%)
- **Persistence**: Soil quality persists through 3 sessions without farming

**Depleted Soil** *(from failed/abandoned farming)*:
- **Visual**: Grayish-brown tint, cracked earth texture
- **Mechanical**: -50% efficiency until restored
- **Restoration**: Special "Soil Treatment" building can restore over 5 turns
- **Natural Recovery**: Depleted soil slowly recovers if left as forest for 2+ sessions

**Contaminated Soil** *(from industrial disasters)*:
- **Visual**: Reddish tint with warning indicators, occasional particle effects
- **Mechanical**: Cannot build residential, -25% efficiency for all buildings
- **Spread**: Contamination slowly spreads to adjacent hexes over multiple sessions
- **Cleanup**: Requires specialized "Remediation" technology and significant resources

### Cultural Sediment Layers

#### Population Memory Imprints
**Beloved Ground** *(sites of sustained happiness)*:
- **Trigger**: 50+ population living happily for 20+ turns
- **Visual**: Hex has subtle warm glow, small memorial flowers at edges
- **Mechanical**: +2 happiness bonus to any residential building
- **Stacking**: Multiple beloved grounds create "Sacred Districts" with enhanced bonuses

**Cursed Ground** *(sites of disaster/abandonment)*:
- **Trigger**: Major population loss from disasters or resource failure
- **Visual**: Subtle dark tint, occasional ghost particle effects
- **Mechanical**: -1 happiness, but +25% resistance to the disaster type that caused it
- **Redemption**: Building successful structures can gradually cleanse cursed ground

**Sacred Ground** *(monument sites)*:
- **Trigger**: Monument stood for 30+ turns
- **Visual**: Hex has permanent golden highlight with architectural remnant
- **Mechanical**: +50% population growth rate, industrial buildings forbidden
- **Cultural Value**: Sacred grounds attract rare cultural events and visitor populations

### Infrastructure Memory

#### Transportation Networks
**Established Drone Routes**:
- **Formation**: Heavy drone traffic over 20+ turns creates permanent flight paths
- **Visual**: Faint glowing trails connecting frequently-traveled hexes
- **Mechanical**: +25% drone movement speed along established routes
- **Network Effects**: Connected routes create efficiency bonuses for entire transport grid

**Abandoned Infrastructure**:
- **Power Line Remnants**: Provide free basic electricity to adjacent hexes
- **Water System Remnants**: Reduce water collection building costs by 50%
- **Communication Networks**: Enable instant resource/population status across entire island

### Session Transition Process

#### World State Calculation
1. **Structure Analysis**: Catalog all buildings, their levels, and operational status
2. **Population Tracking**: Record happiness levels, population distribution, cultural events
3. **Environmental Assessment**: Document soil conditions, contamination, established ecosystems
4. **Infrastructure Mapping**: Record transportation networks, utility grids, cultural sites

#### Transformation Application
1. **Natural Succession**: Convert abandoned agricultural/park areas to forests
2. **Structural Decay**: Transform abandoned buildings into resource piles or ruins
3. **Soil Evolution**: Apply enrichment/depletion based on previous session management
4. **Cultural Imprinting**: Create beloved/cursed/sacred ground markers

#### New Session Preparation
1. **Ruin Distribution**: Place interactive ruins with calculated restoration costs
2. **Resource Placement**: Distribute salvage piles with appropriate material contents
3. **Environmental Setup**: Apply soil modifiers and contamination effects
4. **Memorial Integration**: Ensure existing memorials provide correct adjacency bonuses

### Balancing & Progression

#### Power Scaling Prevention
- **Memorial Saturation**: Maximum 30% of island can be memorialized
- **Resource Pile Decay**: Uncollected resources diminish between sessions
- **Soil Degradation**: Unused enriched soil slowly returns to normal
- **Contamination Spread**: Ignored pollution creates expanding dead zones

#### Strategic Depth Creation
- **Specialization Pressure**: Different ruin choices create different civilization specialties
- **Historical Weight**: Older memorials provide stronger bonuses but occupy premium land
- **Ecological Balance**: Pure efficiency vs sustainable practices create different world states
- **Cultural Continuity**: Maintaining happiness/cultural sites provides cumulative civilization bonuses

This system transforms The Long Tomorrow from a series of isolated games into a **living historical record** where every decision leaves permanent traces in the world's memory.
