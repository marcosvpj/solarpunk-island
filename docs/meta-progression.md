# Meta-Progression System Specification
## **"The Long Tomorrow" - Research & Achievement Framework**

### Core Philosophy
Players unlock permanent upgrades through **achievement-driven research points**, allowing them to specialize their civilization's development path across multiple Long Tomorrow runs. Every run contributes to long-term progress regardless of success or failure.

### Research Point Economy

#### Research Point Sources
**Efficiency Achievements**:
- *"Zero Waste"*: Recycle 20+ buildings in one run → **5 points**
- *"Just In Time"*: Complete any story level with <10 stored fuel → **3 points**  
- *"Perfect Grid"*: All buildings receive adjacency bonuses simultaneously → **4 points**
- *"Resource Sage"*: Maintain 95%+ refinery efficiency for 20 turns → **4 points**

**Survival Achievements**:
- *"Storm Rider"*: Survive 10+ disaster events in one run → **6 points**
- *"Phoenix Rising"*: Rebuild population from <5 to 50+ → **8 points**
- *"The Long Watch"*: Complete 200+ turn Long Tomorrow session → **10 points**
- *"Against All Odds"*: Win any story level after triggering 5+ disasters → **7 points**

**Social Achievements**:
- *"Utopian Society"*: Maintain 100+ population with perfect happiness for 10 turns → **7 points**
- *"True Equality"*: All habitations at same evolution level for 20 turns → **5 points**
- *"Green Paradise"*: 50+ population using only renewable energy → **6 points**
- *"Cultural Renaissance"*: Possess all luxury types simultaneously → **5 points**

**Exploration Achievements**:
- *"Master Builder"*: Construct every building type in one run → **6 points**
- *"Island Chain"*: Manage 5+ islands simultaneously → **12 points**
- *"Archaeological Survey"*: Interact with 50+ ruins across multiple runs → **8 points**

### Research Specialization Trees

#### The Archaeologist Path *(Ruin Mastery)*
**Tier 1** - *"Keen Eye"* *(3 points)*:
- Hovering over ruins reveals their contents and all three potential outcomes
- Memorial placement shows preview of adjacency bonus coverage

**Tier 2** - *"Master Restorer"* *(5 points)*: 
- Restored buildings gain +2 levels instead of +1
- 25% chance restored buildings gain unique "Ancestral" trait (immune to first disaster)

**Tier 3** - *"Living Monument"* *(8 points)*:
- Memorials provide adjacency bonuses to entire hex ring (7 hexes) instead of just adjacent (6 hexes)
- Can upgrade memorials with research points to provide specialized bonuses (production, happiness, efficiency)

#### The Naturalist Path *(Ecological Harmony)*
**Tier 1** - *"Forest Wisdom"* *(3 points)*:
- Natural forests provide +1 material per turn per forest hex
- Can see which parks/farms will become forests next run

**Tier 2** - *"Cultivation Master"* *(5 points)*:
- Can manually plant forests (costs 3 materials, takes 3 turns to grow)
- Agricultural buildings gain +25% efficiency when adjacent to forests

**Tier 3** - *"Symbiotic Architecture"* *(8 points)*:
- Unlock "Living Buildings" that slowly self-repair and grow more efficient over time
- Buildings adjacent to 3+ forests gain "Overgrown" status (+50% efficiency, unique visual with vines/gardens)

#### The Survivor Path *(Disaster Mastery)*
**Tier 1** - *"Storm Sense"* *(4 points)*:
- Early warning system: see incoming disasters 1 turn in advance
- Disaster probability indicators during meteorological events

**Tier 2** - *"Emergency Protocols"* *(6 points)*:
- During disasters, buildings can temporarily share resources with adjacent structures
- 50% chance minor disasters resolve automatically without damage

**Tier 3** - *"Adaptive Infrastructure"* *(10 points)*:
- Buildings automatically repair minor damage over 2-3 turns
- Each disaster survived permanently increases that building's resistance to the same disaster type

#### The Innovator Path *(Technology Focus)*
**Tier 1** - *"Efficient Design"* *(4 points)*:
- All buildings consume 15% less fuel for operations
- Construction costs reduced by 1 material (minimum 1)

**Tier 2** - *"Integrated Systems"* *(7 points)*:
- Unlock "Multi-use" buildings that provide combined functions (Hab-Lab, Refinery-Storage, etc.)
- Research generates passive resources (+1 material per lab per 3 turns)

**Tier 3** - *"Technological Singularity"* *(12 points)*:
- Unlock "AI-Assisted" buildings that optimize their own efficiency automatically
- Can construct "Network Nodes" that share adjacency bonuses across unlimited distance

### Progress Tracking & UI

#### Achievement Journal
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Show advancement toward each achievement
- **Recent Unlocks**: Highlight achievements earned in last 3 sessions  
- **Legacy Gallery**: Screenshots/replays of major achievement moments
- **Research Planner**: Preview research trees, plan point allocation

#### Civilization Profile
- **Total Research Points**: Earned lifetime / Available to spend
- **Specialization Focus**: Visual representation of chosen research paths
- **Achievement Statistics**: Completion rates, personal bests, rare achievements
- **Long Tomorrow History**: Brief log of major accomplishments across runs

### Balancing Considerations

#### Research Point Flow
- **Target Rate**: 8-12 research points per story level completion
- **Long Tomorrow Bonus**: First Long Tomorrow run grants double research points for first 10 achievements
- **Diminishing Returns**: Repeated identical achievements give 50% points after 3rd time

#### Power Scaling
- **Early Game Impact**: Tier 1 upgrades provide 15-25% improvement
- **Mid Game Synergy**: Tier 2 upgrades create new strategic possibilities  
- **Late Game Mastery**: Tier 3 upgrades fundamentally alter gameplay mechanics
