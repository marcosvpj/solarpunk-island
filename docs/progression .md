# 10-Level Progression: Mastery Through Constraints

## Level 1: "First Spark"
**Goal**: Build 1 fuel refinery + 1 material refinery, then survive 3 turns
**New Mechanics**: Basic building, fuel consumption
**Why It's Fun**: Immediate building decisions, teaches the core "build vs survive" tension
**Win Condition**: Have both refineries operational simultaneously for 3 consecutive turns

## Level 2: "Growing Community" 
**Goal**: House 15 people in exactly 3 habitations (5 each)
**New Mechanics**: Population, basic luxury items (water, electricity)
**Constraint**: Cannot build more than 3 habitations
**Why It's Fun**: Forces optimal habitation placement, introduces social layer
**Hidden Teaching**: Adjacency bonuses between habitations

## Level 3: "Perfect Harmony"
**Goal**: Create a 6-building cluster where every building gets an adjacency bonus
**New Mechanics**: Full adjacency system visibility
**Constraint**: Must use exactly 6 buildings around 1 central hex
**Why It's Fun**: Spatial puzzle, multiple valid solutions, "aha!" moment when it clicks
**Emergent Strategy**: Players discover hub-and-spoke vs linear arrangements

## Level 4: "The Dance of Drones"
**Goal**: Operate 3 different drone types simultaneously for 5 turns
**New Mechanics**: Drone specialization, durability, repair cycles
**Constraint**: Cannot have more than 6 total drones
**Why It's Fun**: Resource allocation between drone types, timing maintenance cycles
**Hidden Depth**: Territory management as drones compete for collection zones

## Level 5: "Lean Times"
**Goal**: Reach 20 population while never storing more than 15 fuel
**New Mechanics**: Storage limits create constant pressure
**Constraint**: Forced efficiency, no safety buffer allowed
**Why It's Fun**: Every turn matters, prevents "safe" play, maintains core tension
**Strategy Shift**: From stockpiling to just-in-time economics

## Level 6: "Storm Season"
**Goal**: Survive 3 random negative events without population dropping below 20
**New Mechanics**: Event system, resilience planning
**Constraint**: Events are guaranteed, not random
**Why It's Fun**: Tests adaptability, forces redundancy planning
**Emergent Play**: Players learn to read early warning signs, prepare countermeasures

## Level 7: "The Balancing Act"
**Goal**: Achieve 30 population + monument + maintain 100% renewable energy
**New Mechanics**: Solar panels, monument construction, energy management
**Constraint**: No fuel generators allowed
**Why It's Fun**: Triple optimization challenge, weather affects solar efficiency
**Strategy Revolution**: Completely different energy economics

## Level 8: "Island Fever"
**Goal**: Build on exactly 2 rings (19 hexes total) + reach 40 population
**New Mechanics**: Island expansion, space pressure
**Constraint**: Cannot expand beyond ring 2, cannot demolish
**Why It's Fun**: Perfect placement becomes critical, no take-backs
**Spatial Mastery**: Every hex placement is a permanent strategic choice

## Level 9: "Class Struggle"
**Goal**: Maintain 3 fully evolved habitations + 6 basic habitations simultaneously
**New Mechanics**: Social inequality, happiness propagation between different housing tiers
**Constraint**: Elite habitations must stay elite, basic ones cannot evolve
**Why It's Fun**: Social engineering puzzle, managing happiness across classes
**Moral Tension**: Efficiency vs equality (very solarpunk!)

## Level 10: "Master Architect"
**Goal**: 50 population + weather 5 events + perfect efficiency (reactor never above 70% stress)
**New Mechanics**: All systems combined
**Constraint**: Multiple simultaneous pressures
**Why It's Fun**: Master class combining every learned skill
**Victory Feel**: True accomplishment, demonstrates complete system mastery

## The Progression Psychology

Each level teaches **one new thing** while **constraining something familiar**, preventing the "just build more of everything" solution. Notice how:

- **Levels 1-3**: Core mechanical literacy
- **Levels 4-6**: Dynamic system management  
- **Levels 7-9**: Advanced optimization under pressure
- **Level 10**: Mastery demonstration

## Emergent Dynamics Per Level

**Level 3** will spawn community discussions about optimal hex arrangements
**Level 5** creates speed-running opportunities (fastest to 20 pop)
**Level 7** might reveal solar panel placement metas
**Level 9** could generate philosophical debates about inequality in games

## Hidden Brilliance: No Level Has the Same Victory Condition

Players can't just optimize one strategy and repeat it. Each level demands different thinking, keeping the game fresh while building cumulative mastery.

The constraints aren't arbitrary limitations - they're **surgical tools** that force players to explore different facets of your hexagonal systems. By the end, players haven't just learned the game - they've **internalized multiple ways to think about the same systems**.

What do you think about the constraint-based approach? Does Level 9's social engineering feel too complex, or does it hit the right note for solarpunk themes?
